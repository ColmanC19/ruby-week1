# _Anagram Detector_

#### _This application will determine if two words are an anagram. Two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in a different order. For example, "ruby" and "bury" are anagrams because they contain the same letters. This project was done in Ruby and was tested using the ruby gem 'rspec'. 12.13.2019_

## Description

1. Checks if two words are an anagram.
2. Account for the possibility that words might have different cases but should still be anagrams. For instance, "Tea" is still an anagram of "Eat".
3. Will verify that the words being input are actual words. "ruby bury" are real words and an anagram. Example: "ruby yurb" are not because "yurb" is not a word.
4. Will check if the words input have zero similar letters in them. Example: "hi bye" is an Antigram because they have zero similar numbers.
5. Account for multiple words being anagrams or "antigrams". This will take into account spaces and punctuation.
